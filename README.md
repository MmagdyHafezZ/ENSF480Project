# ENSF480Project

Hey everyone,

I figured it would be good to make a Git Repository for us. I think the best method for this will be for each of us to make our own dev branch and work on that, and whenever there is good progress we can merge it to a production branch. When we are happy with the production branch we can merge it to the main branch which we will use for submission. I know it is a little confusing but it keep our branches clean, the main branch clean, and if two people accidentally merge to the production branch with different code, we won't have to worry about rebasing the main which could lead to a lot of potential issues, such as losing code.

to run the code go to the "thebackend" and run "mvn spring-boot:run" 
to run the frontend go to Frontend/FlightWeb and run "npm run dev" 

install all the dependencies before running the commands
